### Fixed

- Fixed issue with Customer Token generation API requiring form-urlencoded content type
- Sorted Customer operations alphabetically for better usability
- Fixed pagination issue with MSP Events List where the Druva API exhibits unusual behavior - first page returns many items (400+) but subsequent pages return only 1 item. Updated pagination logic to handle this scenario correctly by:
  - Implementing the API's requirement that when using `pageToken`, no other query parameters should be present
  - Adding safeguards against infinite loops by tracking previously seen page tokens
  - Adding detailed logging to monitor pagination behavior
  - Improving cursor-based pagination implementation to respect API design
- Updated Tenant filtering to use a single Customer ID as per API documentation, which only supports filtering by one customer at a time
- Fixed Tenant filtering query parameter name from 'customerId' to 'customerIds' to match the API's expected parameter name

### Changed

- Implemented proper pagination handling for all list endpoints
- Added consistent error handling and logging across all API calls
- Renamed Events operations from 'listMsp' and 'listCustomer' to 'getManyMspEvents' and 'getManyCustomerEvents' for consistency with n8n naming conventions
- Enhanced Customer picklist implementation with alphabetical sorting and improved display names
- Improved error handling and removed excessive debug logging across option loaders
- Next focus area: Complete implementation and testing of the Tenant resource
- Renamed Tenant operation from 'list' to 'getMany' for consistency with n8n naming conventions
- Updated Tenant filtering to use a single customer ID dropdown with dynamic loading of customer options
- Added ApiValueConverters utility with functions to convert numeric API values to human-readable labels:
  - Tenant status codes (0-5) are now displayed with descriptive names (e.g., "Ready", "Suspended")
  - Tenant type codes (1-3) are now displayed with descriptive names (e.g., "Sandbox", "Commercial")
  - Product ID codes (1-2) are now displayed with descriptive names (e.g., "Hybrid Workloads")
  - API responses are automatically enriched with human-readable labels while preserving original values
- Added post-processing filter options for Tenant status and Tenant type in the Get Many operation, allowing users to filter results by these fields using friendly picklists

## Notes

This initial release focuses on establishing the core infrastructure for Druva MSP API integration. The Admin, Customer, and Event resources have been thoroughly tested and are considered production-ready. The remaining resources require additional testing before being used in production environments.
